Good evening, night cruisers. This is the {{CITY}} Retro Crime Report, transmitting across the neon grid. Law enforcement drones have been deployed after a string of synth-cap heists lit up the district tonight. Authorities say the perpetrators escaped on lightcycles, leaving behind trails of ultraviolet residue.

Residents are advised to avoid the lower alleys near Circuit Row until investigators finish sweeping for cybernetic signatures. Patrol officers report increased scanner interference, likely caused by unauthorized signal jammers.

Stay alert, stay sharp, and keep your comms open. More updates after this short atmospheric break.
